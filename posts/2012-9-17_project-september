Project September begins my long term project to build an autonomous quadcopter
from scratch.

This observer will utilize both parts from the [diydrones](http://diydrones.com/) Arducopter
and a custom brain based on the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) or some other
architecture

My goal is to build this from scratch, but may have to end up cribbing code from other sources.

### Timeline

#### Phase I

* Build brain
* Understand GPIO and other basic I/O
* Interact with motors/electronics

#### Phase II

* Understand quadcopter construction
* Understand basic quadcopter physics and aerodynamics

#### Phase III

* Put the brain and the quadcopter together
* Give pathing instructions to do missions

#### Phase IV

* Add sonar/sensors to help quadcopter understand its environment

#### Phase V

* Create mission for `copter to autonomously patrol area and react to obstacles
